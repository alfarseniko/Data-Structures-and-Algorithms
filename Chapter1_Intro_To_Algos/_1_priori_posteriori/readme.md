    Priori Analysis is done for algorithms before they are built as programs
        We need to analyze everything it will do and return
        the total amount of time and space it will occupy
        It is language independent
    
    Posteriori Analysis is done after the program has been written
        We analyze the run time of the program and the
        amount of memory that it occupies to run that program
        It is always written in a programming language
