# FREQUENCY COUNT METHOD

The frequency count method uses each operation and then counts the number of times such operations are carried out.

For the given simple for loop,
 1. Time Complexity
        Each operation counts as one unit of time and the function for time complexity becomes
        f(n) = 2n + 3   -> O(n)
 2. Space Complexity
        The space required for storing all variables being manipulated is the space complexity
        -   A is an array so it has n words
        -   All other variables are just single words
        The function for space complexity becomes
        s(n) = n + 3    -> O(n)
