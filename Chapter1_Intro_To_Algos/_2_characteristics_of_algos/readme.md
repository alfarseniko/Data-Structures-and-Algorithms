CHARACTERISTICS OF AN ALGORITHM

    1.INPUT
        An algorithm can have 0 or more inputs.

    2. OUTPUT
        An algorithm should have atleast 1 output. There has to be
        something that aur algorithm is processsing and returning.

    3. DEFINITENESS
        The algorithm should be crystal clear in its instructions and
        should not allow for impossible things to happen

    4. FINITENESS
        An algorithm must end. It should not just keep running forever.

    5. EFFECTIVENESS
        This means that the steps of an algorithm should be such that
        they 100% contribute to the logic. No unneccessary steps.
